# Analysis of Mental Health Trends and Patterns in The US

# Introduction
- This application was created for me to explore the data science field, specifically data analytics and data engineering flows.  I started this project by identifying some of the data sources that 
  I wanted to create insights from, cleaned the data, and tried to formulate meaningful questions.

## Goals
- Learn and understand the ETL Flow
- Learn and understand common tools (i.e. Apache airflow, Apache nifi, etc.) used for data engineering
- Learn how to manipulate data with Python
- Identify key data insights

# Tools Overview
## Docker
* Allows users to easily install and run software without worrying about the setup or dependencies
* Used to manage individual containers or multiple containers (i.e. docker-compose)

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Image | single file with all the dependencies and configurations required to run a program |
| Container | Instance of an image; runs a program |

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| docker run | create a container using an image |
| docker ps | list all the running containers currently on your machine |
| docker create | create a container; will generate a container ID |
| docker logs <container-ID> | retrieve logs from a specific container |
| docker stop <container-ID> | shutdown container |
| docker-compose up | start multiple containers |
| docker-compose down | stop multiple containers |
