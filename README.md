# Analysis of Mental Health Trends and Patterns in The US

# Introduction
- This application was created for me to explore the data science field, specifically data analytics and data engineering flows.  I started this project by identifying some of the data sources that 
  I wanted to create insights from, cleaned the data, and tried to formulate meaningful questions.

## Goals
- Learn and understand the ETL Flow
- Learn and understand common AWS services used for data engineering
- Learn how to manipulate data with Python
- Identify key data insights
